# Zolo File Manager 
**Version 1.0**

Hi! **Zolo File Manager** is a file manager (for windows) based on *Python 3.7*. It was made by [Aman Binjola](www.github.com/binjolaaman10) as a personal project. With this python based file explorer you can view files, folders and perform actions on them. Actions such as moving them, deleting them (permanently or sending them to recycle bin).

*This project is a work in progress.*

## Usage
Python 3.7 or above is recommended for using this program.
You need to install a few libraries too. You can do these by using the following commands:

> pip install send2trash

> pip install os

> pip install shutil

**send2trash** is a python module that sends files/folders to Recycle Bin instead of permanently deleting it.
**os** is a python module that is used to perform various functions on files and folders.
**shutil** is yet another python module to perform various functions on files and folders 

## Functions you can perform on files/folders

 1. Delete files/folder permanently
 2. Send files/folder to Recycle Bin
 3. Directly open files from the manager
 4. Expand folders
 5. Move files/folders to another location
 6. Copy files/folders to another location
 
 ## Features that may be added in the future
 
 1. A GUI made using Tkinter
 2. Ability to add your favorite folders in Quick Access
